#  Dynamic serverless application by using AWS Lambda Service

## Deploying and Delivering a web application by using IAM, AWS Lambda, API Gateway and DynamoDB. 


In this Project the API Gateway act as a front end, Dynamo DB act as a backend, AWS Lambda act as a web server and IAM role is used to create an AWS Lambda function

### Description:

Building a dynamic serverless application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, IAM, and DynamoDB enables scalable and efficient backend solutions without server management. Lambda handles on-demand code execution, API Gateway provides RESTful endpoints for user interactions, IAM manages secure access, and DynamoDB offers a fast, scalable NoSQL database. This architecture delivers cost-effectiveness, automatic scaling, and high availabilityâ€”ideal for modern cloud-based applications. #AWS #Serverless #DevOps #CloudComputing #DynamoDB #Lambda
